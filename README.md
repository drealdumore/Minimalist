# Minimalist

A simple, user-friendly Todo app built using Next.js and Supabase. The app allows users to manage their tasks without authentication. Each user is assigned a unique ID stored in the browserâ€™s local storage, and tasks are stored and synced with a Supabase database.

## Features

- Add, update, and delete tasks.
- Automatically saves and retrieves user-specific tasks.
- User-specific data stored in local storage using unique IDs.
- Supabase as a backend for database operations.
- No authentication required.
